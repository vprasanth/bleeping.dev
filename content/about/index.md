## Hiya!

I'm Prasanth Vaaheeswaran and welcome to **bleeping development**. This will
mainly be a space for myself to jot down things I found useful which I can
quickly refer back to and share. Honestly, it'll also most likely be a place for
me to vent :)

### A little about me

I'm currently a Staff Engineer at Clearco ([come check us
out!](https://clear.co)). Prior to that I worked with some amazing folks at
[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and [IBM](https://ibm.com). Since COVID, I've worked
remotely from about 40 minutes (_on a good day_) outside of [Toronto,
Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto).

My background is in software (cloud) and I've been fortunate enough to work in
many different parts of the stack.

### Goals for this site

- useful resources for myself and friends
- build a routine around sharing ideas and writing

### How to get in touch

Email is king.
